The purpose of the project is to analyze diabetic patient data to identify trends and patterns that can aid in improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in predicting diabetes. By exploring specific factors such as pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and age, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of diagnosing diabetes and provide insights for better preventive healthcare measures.
